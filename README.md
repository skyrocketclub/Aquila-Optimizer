# Aquila-Optimizer

Aquila Optimizer (AO) is a novel population-based optimization method, which is inspired by the Aquila's behaviors in nature during the process of catching the prey. It is implemented in C++

Steps to take in order to use the Aquila Algorithm program

Edit the Objective Function in the Helper.cpp
Edit the factor Boundaries vector of vectors in the helper.cpp (CheckBoundary function) and in the Main.cpp
Edit the other parameters like the population size and the number of iterations in the main...

Always run this program while in the main.cpp file. It has to be the active file
